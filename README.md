# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They can be installed running the `./deploy.zsh` script. The contents of this repository must be placed in the directory `~/repos/dotfiles`, but this location can be modified changing the value of the `DOTFILES` variable in `deploy.zsh`.

An additional file `~/.custom_config.zsh` can be created to include machine-specific settings.

I don't recommend installing these dotfiles on your computer unless you are me, whom I think you aren't ;).
